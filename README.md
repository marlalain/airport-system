# Airport System [WIP]

This project is an airport system made with event-driven architecture. Diagrams and code for it are not yet done as I need to study for a few things before starting it.

If you want to see full-stack systems that I made, the only one I published is [MV (front)](https://github.com/paulo-e/mv-front) and [MV (back)](https://github.com/paulo-e/mv-back). Keep in mind that I wrote this a few months back and I have a much better understanding of Angular, Spring and HTTP now. If you want to see the best that I have published in GitHub, you can go to [slinky](https://github.com/paulo-e/slinky). Blog-style information about this project can be found [here](https://devlog.pauloelienay.com/projects/slinky/).
